<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
 
 I very much enjoy cooking in my free time. I've worked in and out of kitchens as a sous chef and pizza chef for a majortiy of my life
 and have accumulated many cool bits of knowledge and recipes over time. I wanted to make a place to store them, and share them with
 family members or friends, as well as save my grandparent's recipes to use down the road. So I made this app.
 
 CookBook is a simple fullstack web application made to store recipes. Users will be able to log in and upload their recipes, as well as 
 explore, like, and bookmark other user recipes. Options to search, organize recipes by criteria such as type of food, country of origin, or 
 allergen specific, and other quality of life options will be implemented in the future.
